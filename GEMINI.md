This is a Reinforcement Learning (RL) project.

The project seems to be structured as follows:
- `models/`: Contains implementations of various RL algorithms like DPO, MAB (Multi-Armed Bandit), MDP (Markov Decision Process), and PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization).
- `examples/`: Contains example usage of the RL algorithms, such as a Q-Learning example for a robot in a maze.
- `logs/`: Seems to be used for storing logs from runs of the RL models.
- `dataset/`: Might contain datasets used for training or testing the RL models.
- `utils/`: Contains utility scripts.
- `plots.py`: A script for generating plots, likely for visualizing results.
- `run.py`: A script to run experiments.

When working on this project, please adhere to the existing structure and conventions.
